This is my brainstorming scratchpad, please ignore

- Settings done per game
    - Time allowed to answer (default depends on # of players, Sequential play only); numeric up/down
        - 2P: 20s
        - 3-4P: 15s
        - 5P+: 10s
    - Selected sources; checklistbox
    - Selected categories; checklistbox
    - Allow hint when questions do not provide a choice (first letter); true/false

- Types of games:
    - Single Player
        - Questions are sequential
        - Scoring: 100 pts per question
        - Save slots available to track:
            - Already answered questions
            - Score
            - Total questions answered
            - Game settings
    - Multiplayer
        - Sequential
            - 2-10 players
            - All players get different questions
            - Scoring: 100 pts per question
            - When a question is failed:
                - 2-player mode: the other player will be given a chance to answer the failed question for full points
                - 3+ player mode: 
                    - Option A: anyone can answer, but points will be split evenly across players
                        - Points = 100 \ (players - 1)
            - Number of rounds (10/25/40/Endless quick picks... or custom value from 5)
            - Person with highest score wins at the end
        - Round Table
            - 3-10 players
            - All players sequentially answer the same question, at the end of each round the answer is revealed
            - The order of player is reversed on every other question, i.e. question 1 is answered by P1, P2, P3 then P4, question 2 is answered by P4, P3, P2 then P1, and so forth.
        - Family Feud (added AFTER - this would be a brilliant addition as we do have a free source of family feud questions!)
            - 2-10 players
            - Thing plays like Family Feud
